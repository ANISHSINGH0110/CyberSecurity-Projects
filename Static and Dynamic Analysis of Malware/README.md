# 🛡️ Static and Dynamic Malware Analysis

This project presents a detailed static and dynamic analysis of a malware sample named `Malware.Unknown.exe.malz`. The objective was to analyze its behavior, uncover indicators of compromise (IOCs), and understand its host- and network-level impact using a combination of analysis tools.

## 📁 File Analyzed
- **Filename:** `Malware.Unknown.exe.malz`

---

## 🔍 Static Analysis

### Tools Used:
- [FLOSS](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-floss)

### Key Findings:
- **Command execution:** The malware executes the command `cmd.exe /C ping 1.1.1.1 -n 1 -w 3000` indicating network-based behavior (possibly domain beaconing).
- **Suspicious URL:** Communicates with internal domain: `http://ssl-6582datamanager.helpdeskbros.local/favicon.ico`
- **File creation:** Generates a new file `CR433101.dat.exe` under `C:\Users\Public\Documents\`, indicating host-based persistence.
- **Self-deletion:** Uses the command `> Nul & Del /f /q` to delete itself post-execution.

## ⚙️ Dynamic Analysis

### Environment:
- **FlareVM**
- **REMnux + INetSim**
- **Wireshark**
- **Procmon**

---

### 🔗 Network-Based Analysis

- **Packet Capture Tool:** Wireshark
- **Protocol:** HTTP
- **Observed URI:** `GET /favicon.ico` to internal host `ssl-6582datamanager.helpdeskbros.local`
- **Behavior:** Malware attempts to establish a connection and retrieve a favicon, simulating benign traffic.

---

### 💻 Host-Based Analysis

- **File System Behavior:**  
  Created a disguised executable file `CR433101.dat.exe` in the public documents folder.

- **Execution Chain:**  
  Malware runs a command that pings an external IP and then deletes itself from the system:
  ```bash
  cmd.exe /C ping 1.1.1.1 -n 1 -w 3000 > Nul & Del /f /q "Malware.Unknown.exe"
